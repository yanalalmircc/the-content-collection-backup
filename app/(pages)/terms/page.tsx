                To use our Site, you may need to register an account with us

                accurate and complete information and maintain the security of

              <p className="basic-text">
                We offer subscription packages for access to additional features
                and areas of the Site. Detailed information on subscription
                plans (&ldquo;Subscription&rdquo;) is available on the Site. Our
                standard offerings include a 1-day access option ($1.00) and
                monthly renewal packages ($59.99). Your Subscription will
                automatically renew monthly unless cancelled by you. If you
                initially paid by credit card, the same card will be charged
                upon each Subscription renewal. Payments will not be processed
                before the end of the current subscription period. Successful
                transactions extend your Subscription under the original terms.
                Should there be any changes in Subscription pricing, we will
                provide advance notice. Continuing to use the Service after such
                a change implies acceptance of the new pricing.

                You can terminate your 1-day or monthly subscription at any time
                by following the instructions in the relevant part of the Site.
                Subscription cancellations can be processed through: (i) the “My
                Account” section of the Site by following the “Remove Your
                Account” link; (ii) submitting a Subscription Cancellation form;
                or (iii) contacting our Support team with a request. Refunds for
                partial-month subscriptions or unused services are not provided.
                Upon cancellation, you retain access until the end of the
                current paid period. The Company may terminate your Account
                without notice if you breach these Terms, and no refund will be
                granted. Following termination, these Terms, except those
                intended to survive, will expire.
